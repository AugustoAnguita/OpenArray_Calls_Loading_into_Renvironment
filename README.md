# OpenArray_Calls_Loading_into_Renvironment
This repository holds a short script that allow loading a genetic dataset (genotype calls) derived from the OpenArray technology and transforming it into a handly-format file, which can be further imported to PLINK software. Basically, this script carries out a dataset manipulation and transformation from long to wide format.

In order to run the script, you will need:

  1. An input file derived from OpenArray technology in the long format containing information for three colums (NCBI_SNP_Reference,Sample_ID and	Genotype_Call).
  
  2. Change the arguments "aa" and "cc" according to your experimental design and characteristics.
