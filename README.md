# OpenArray_Calls_Loading_into_Renvironment
This short script allows to load the genotype calls derived from the OpenArray technology and transform them into a handly format which can be imported to PLINK software.

In order to run the script, you will need:

  1. An input file derived from OpenArray technology in the long format with three colums (NCBI_SNP_Reference,Sample_ID and	Genotype_Call).
  2. Change the arguments "aa" and "cc" according to your experimental design.
